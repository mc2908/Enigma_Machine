Remaining Tasks:

Commenting code throughout:
        Rotor
        RotorCase
        Enigma
        Plugboard
        Pluglead
        code_cracking
On Crack_code instead of returing the full list or reflector wiring, return only the differences with respec the standard configurations.
Think of changin file names from capital case to lwoer case
        Rotor --> rotor
        Reflector --> reflector
        PlugLead --> pluglead
        Plugboard --> pluglead
        Rotorcase --> rotorcase
