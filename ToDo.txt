Remaining Tasks:

Commenting code throughout:
        Rotor       DONE
        RotorCase   DONE
        Enigma      TODO
        Plugboard   DONE
        Pluglead    DONE
        code_cracking DONE
On break_code instead of returing the full list or reflector wiring, return only the differences with respec the standard configurations.
Think of changin file names from capital case to lwoer case
        Rotor --> rotor                 DONE
        Reflector --> reflector         DONE
        PlugLead --> pluglead           DONE
        Plugboard --> pluglead          DONE
        Rotorcase --> rotorcase         DONE
